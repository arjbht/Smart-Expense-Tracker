APK Build Instructions (local)
This environment cannot compile Android APKs. Follow these steps locally:

1. Open Android Studio.
2. File -> New -> Import Project... and choose this folder (the module 'app' contains Gradle files).
3. Let Gradle sync. If missing SDK, install required SDK (compileSdkVersion 34).
4. Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s).
5. After build, click 'locate' to find the APK at:
   app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

If you'd like, I can add a GitHub Actions workflow file to auto-build the debug APK on push.
